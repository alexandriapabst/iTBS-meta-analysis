# iTBS-meta-analysis
Repository for R-code conducting meta-analysis on effect of intermittent theta burst stimulation on cognitive enhancement.

Hi! The code contained within this repository demonstrates how Pabst and colleagues conducted the meta-analysis that is currently awaiting peer review.

The code is in R Markdown format, and alongside each chunk of code, there are explanations for why specific decisions were made during the meta-analysis. 
Of course, this won't be a complete explanation, so if you'd like a more thorough understanding of the underlying theory of intermittent theta burst stimulation and its involvement in cognitive enhancement (and additionally, what we mean by cognitive enhancement), please see our preprint located here:

The data for conducting the meta-analysis itself are available on OSF, located here: https://osf.io/fq5c6/

Additionally, this meta-analysis was conducted with the help of the "dmetar" package, created by Mathias Harrer. This is a great guide for understanding how to conduct complicated meta-analyses in a variety of ways, and is what we used to help guide our meta-analysis. Please check out their guide, located here:
